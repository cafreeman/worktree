## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2025-08-29

### Added

- **New Commands:**
  - `worktree back` - Navigate back to original repository from worktrees
  - `worktree cleanup` - Clean up orphaned branches and git references
- **Enhanced Shell Integration:**
  - Better completion support for all commands
  - Native bash/zsh/fish shell functions with improved directory changing
- **Origin Tracking & Cleanup:**
  - Automatic storage of origin repository paths in `.worktree-origins` metadata
  - Proper cleanup of origin information when worktrees are removed
  - Back navigation support that works reliably for all worktrees
- **Cargo Release Infrastructure:**
  - Initial cargo-release configuration for automated publishing
  - Streamlined release workflow with version management

### Changed

- **Smart Branch/Worktree Synchronization (BREAKING CHANGES):**
  - `create` command now automatically creates branches when needed (removed `-b/--create-branch` flag)
  - Added `--new-branch` flag to force new branch creation (fails if branch exists)
  - Added `--existing-branch` flag to require existing branch (fails if branch doesn't exist)
  - `remove` command now deletes branches by default (removed `-d/--delete-branch` flag)
  - Added `--keep-branch` flag to preserve branches when removing worktrees
- **Simplified Architecture:**
  - All worktrees now use centralized storage exclusively in `~/.worktrees/<repo>/<branch>/`
  - Improved mental model: one worktree = one branch
  - Atomic operations with comprehensive pre-flight validation

### Removed

- **Custom Path Support:**
  - Removed `-p/--path` CLI option from create command
  - Removed custom path handling from remove command logic
  - Simplified codebase with consistent worktree management

### Fixed

- Fixed "reference already exists" error when creating worktrees
- Resolved branch/worktree synchronization issues where they could get out of sync
- Enhanced error messages that guide users to correct solutions
- Proper cleanup of git references and filesystem state
