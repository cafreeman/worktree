# Worktree CLI

A powerful CLI tool for managing git worktrees with enhanced features including centralized storage, automatic config file synchronization, and intelligent branch management.

## Features

- üóÇÔ∏è **Centralized Storage** - Organizes worktrees in `~/.worktrees/<repo-name>/<branch-name>/`
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Smart Config Management** - Automatically copies gitignored config files to new worktrees
- üîÑ **Branch Synchronization** - Keeps worktrees and git branches in sync
- üìã **Comprehensive Status** - Shows detailed worktree and branch status
- üéØ **Configurable Patterns** - Customize which files to copy via `.worktree-config.toml`
- üõ°Ô∏è **Safe Branch Names** - Automatically sanitizes branch names with slashes and special characters

## Installation

### 1. Build and Install the Binary

```bash
# Clone and build the project
git clone <repository-url>
cd worktree
cargo build --release

# Install the binary (choose one option)
sudo cp target/release/worktree-bin /usr/local/bin/
# OR add to your PATH
cp target/release/worktree-bin ~/.local/bin/  # ensure ~/.local/bin is in PATH
```

### 2. Set Up Shell Integration

The `worktree` command is a shell function that wraps `worktree-bin` to enable directory changing and enhanced completions. You need to set this up for your shell:

#### Bash

Add to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`:

```bash
# Generate and source worktree shell integration
eval "$(worktree-bin init bash)"
```

#### Zsh

Add to your `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
# Generate and source worktree shell integration
eval "$(worktree-bin init zsh)"
```

#### Fish

Add to your Fish config (`~/.config/fish/config.fish`):

```fish
# Generate and source worktree shell integration
worktree-bin init fish | source
```

### 3. Enable Shell Completions (Optional)

For enhanced tab completions, add these to your shell config:

#### Bash

```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc
eval "$(worktree-bin completions bash)"
```

#### Zsh

```bash
# Add to ~/.zshrc  
eval "$(worktree-bin completions zsh)"
```

#### Fish

```fish
# Add to ~/.config/fish/config.fish
worktree-bin completions fish | source
```

### 4. Reload Your Shell

```bash
# Reload your shell configuration
source ~/.bashrc   # for bash
source ~/.zshrc    # for zsh
# or restart your terminal
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
# Test that worktree command is available
worktree --help

# Test shell integration works
worktree status
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Check current status
worktree status

# Create a new worktree for feature development
worktree create feature/auth

# Create a worktree with a new branch
worktree create -b new-feature

# List all worktrees
worktree list

# List worktrees for current repo only
worktree list --current

# Remove a worktree
worktree remove feature/auth

# Remove worktree and delete the branch
worktree remove feature/auth --delete-branch
```

## Commands

### `create` - Create a new worktree

```bash
worktree create <branch> [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

- `-p, --path <PATH>` - Custom path for the worktree (optional)
- `-b, --create-branch` - Create a new branch if it doesn't exist

**Examples:**

```bash
# Create worktree for existing branch
worktree create feature/login

# Create worktree with new branch
worktree create -b feature/new-thing

# Create worktree at custom location
worktree create feature/auth --path ~/custom/path
```

### `list` - List all worktrees

```bash
worktree list [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

- `--current` - Show worktrees for current repo only

**Examples:**

```bash
# List all managed worktrees
worktree list

# List worktrees for current repository
worktree list --current
```

### `remove` - Remove a worktree

```bash
worktree remove <target> [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

- `-d, --delete-branch` - Also delete the associated branch

**Examples:**

```bash
# Remove worktree by branch name
worktree remove feature/auth

# Remove worktree and delete branch
worktree remove feature/auth --delete-branch

# Remove worktree by path
worktree remove ~/.worktrees/my-project/feature-auth
```

### `status` - Show worktree status

```bash
worktree status
```

Displays comprehensive information about:

- Git worktrees vs managed worktrees
- Directory existence status
- Synchronization state
- Repository information

### `sync-config` - Sync config files between worktrees

```bash
worktree sync-config <from> <to>
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# Sync config from main to feature branch
worktree sync-config main feature/auth

# Sync using paths
worktree sync-config ~/.worktrees/project/main ~/.worktrees/project/feature
```

## Configuration

### `.worktree-config.toml`

Create a `.worktree-config.toml` file in your repository root to customize which files are copied to new worktrees:

```toml
[copy-patterns]
include = [
    ".env*",
    ".vscode/",
    "*.local.json",
    "config/local/*",
    ".idea/",
    "docker-compose.override.yml"
]
exclude = [
    "node_modules/",
    "target/",
    ".git/",
    "*.log",
    "*.tmp",
    "dist/",
    "build/"
]
```

**Default patterns (if no config file exists):**

Include:

- `.env*` - Environment files
- `.vscode/` - VS Code settings
- `*.local.json` - Local configuration files
- `config/local/*` - Local config directories

Exclude:

- `node_modules/`, `target/` - Build artifacts
- `.git/` - Git directory
- `*.log`, `*.tmp` - Temporary files

## Storage Organization

Worktrees are organized in a clean, predictable structure:

```
~/.worktrees/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ my-project/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature-auth/          # branch: feature/auth
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bugfix-login/          # branch: bugfix/login
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ develop/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ another-repo/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ feature-xyz/           # branch: feature/xyz
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ third-project/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ experimental/
```

**Branch Name Sanitization:**
Branch names containing slashes and special characters are automatically sanitized for safe filesystem storage:

- `feature/auth` ‚Üí `feature-auth/`
- `bugfix/critical-issue` ‚Üí `bugfix-critical-issue/`
- `release/v1.0` ‚Üí `release-v1.0/`

The original branch names are preserved and displayed in all commands.

## Use Cases

### 1. Feature Development

```bash
# Start working on a new feature
worktree create -b feature/payments

# Work in the new worktree
cd ~/.worktrees/my-project/feature-payments

# When done, remove it
worktree remove feature/payments --delete-branch
```

### 2. Bug Fixes on Multiple Branches

```bash
# Create worktrees for different versions
worktree create release/v1.0
worktree create release/v2.0

# Apply fixes to both
# Config files are automatically synced
```

### 3. Code Review

```bash
# Create temporary worktree for PR review
worktree create pr-123

# Review code without affecting main workspace
cd ~/.worktrees/my-project/pr-123

# Clean up when done
worktree remove pr-123
```

### 4. Development Environment Management

```bash
# Sync updated config to all worktrees
worktree sync-config main feature/auth
worktree sync-config main bugfix/critical

# Check which worktrees need attention
worktree status
```

## Troubleshooting

### Worktree exists but not in git

```bash
worktree status  # Shows inconsistent state
# Remove the directory manually and recreate
```

### Config files not copying

1. Check `.worktree-config.toml` syntax
2. Verify file patterns match your files
3. Ensure files aren't excluded by exclude patterns

### Permission issues

```bash
# Ensure worktree directory is writable
chmod -R u+w ~/.worktrees/
```

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Storage Location

Set a custom worktree storage location by modifying the storage module or using environment variables (future enhancement).

### Integration with IDEs

The consistent storage structure makes it easy to:

- Configure IDE project templates
- Set up automated workflows
- Create shell aliases for common operations

### Shell Aliases

Add these to your shell profile for convenience:

```bash
alias wt='worktree'
alias wtc='worktree create'
alias wtl='worktree list --current'
alias wts='worktree status'
```
